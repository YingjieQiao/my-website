Weird enough, the above link doesn't work if you are using "SUTD_WiFi" for unknown reasons. 
But you can use type *139.162.46.158* into yur web browser to go to my website instead.

The website is not encrypted with HTTPS because my server is Ubuntu 20 and the free SSL service I was looking at is not updated to be comparable with this version of Ubuntu yet:
