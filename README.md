# Hello there!

~www.yingjieqiao.me~ I don't know why namespace.com banned my domain, by please access my website using **139.162.46.158** for now.

Weird enough, *the above link doesn't work if you are using **"SUTD_WiFi"*** for unknown reasons. 
But you can use type **139.162.46.158** into your web browser to go to my website instead.

The website is not encrypted with HTTPS because my server is Ubuntu 20 and the free SSL service I was looking at is not updated to be comparable with this version of Ubuntu yet:

May 14 2020 update: add in comment under post functionality

TODO

Deploy the website onto a server running on Ubuntu 18, as it is known that this version is compatible with HTTPS.
